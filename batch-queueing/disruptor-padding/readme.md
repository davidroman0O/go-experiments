This implementation includes:

The core Disruptor components: RingBuffer, Sequence, Producer, and Consumer.
Three different WaitStrategy implementations: BusySpinWaitStrategy, YieldingWaitStrategy, and SleepingWaitStrategy.
A main function that runs tests for different configurations, including different wait strategies and consumer counts.

Each test runs for one second, measuring the number of events produced and consumed, and calculates the throughput in millions of operations per second.
