The results look promising. Let's analyze the output:

1. The code is now successfully running without data races, which is a significant improvement.
2. Performance in non-race mode is much better than in race mode, which is expected.
3. Dispatch mode:
   - Performance scales down with more consumers, which is expected as the work is being divided.
   - BusySpinWaitStrategy performs best, followed by YieldingWaitStrategy, then SleepingWaitStrategy, and finally BlockingWaitStrategy. This aligns with expectations based on the strategies' designs.
4. Broadcast mode:
   - With 2 consumers, we see roughly double the consumption compared to 1 consumer, which is correct for broadcast behavior.
   - Performance is generally lower than in Dispatch mode, which makes sense as each event is being processed multiple times.
5. The throughput numbers are impressive, especially in non-race mode:
   - We're seeing up to 968 million ops/sec in Dispatch mode with a single consumer.
   - Broadcast mode achieves up to 255 million ops/sec.
6. The consumed count is lower than the produced count in Dispatch mode, which is expected as the test may end before all produced items are consumed.
7. In Broadcast mode, the consumed count is approximately equal to (single consumer) or double (two consumers) the produced count, which is correct.

These results suggest that the implementation is working as intended and performing well. The different modes (Dispatch and Broadcast) are behaving correctly, and the various wait strategies are showing expected performance characteristics.

To further improve or validate the implementation, you might consider:

1. Testing with more consumers to see how it scales.
2. Running longer tests to ensure stability over time.
3. Profiling the code to identify any remaining bottlenecks.
4. Testing on different hardware configurations to understand performance characteristics across various systems.

Overall, this implementation appears to be a solid, high-performance Disruptor pattern in Go, successfully addressing the initial concerns and providing the desired functionality.
